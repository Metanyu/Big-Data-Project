Perfect ‚Äî since your team already has roles and a clear system design, we can now turn that into a **practical, week-by-week roadmap** designed for both learning and parallel development.

This plan assumes you‚Äôre starting from your **local Kafka prototype** and aiming for a **Kappa architecture deployment on Kubernetes with Strimzi (KRaft) + Schema Registry + Spark + Cassandra + Grafana**.

## üß≠ Next Steps You Can Start *Now*

1. Initialize a shared **GitHub repo**:

   ```
   /kafka/
   /spark/
   /cassandra/
   /grafana/
   /k8s/
   /docs/
   ```
2. Add a `README.md` that tracks weekly progress.
3. Assign everyone their Week 1‚Äì2 learning tasks (I can list good materials for each person if you want next).

---

Would you like me to make a **Week 1‚Äì2 learning plan with links and tutorials** tailored for each member (Kafka, Spark, Cassandra, Grafana, Deployment)?
That would help everyone ramp up smoothly in parallel.
