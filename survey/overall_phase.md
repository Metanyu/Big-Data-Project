Great — I’ll turn your meeting notes into a thorough, actionable **project plan** focused on the **Kappa architecture** (stream-first) and **Kafka in KRaft mode** running on Kubernetes. I’ll split it into phases, give specific tasks that team members can work on in parallel, learning resources, concrete outputs (YAML / code / tests) and checkpoints, plus practical deployment notes. I’ll also call out important gotchas (Strimzi/KRaft, Spark-on-K8s, local dev). I’ll cite a few authoritative sources for the most important claims (Strimzi KRaft support, Spark on Kubernetes operator).

# High-level goals (what success looks like)

1. A K8s-based streaming pipeline where simulated taxi events → Kafka (KRaft) → Spark Structured Streaming → Cassandra → Grafana.
2. Repeatable repo + CI to build images, deploy Helm/YAML, and run e2e tests locally (Docker Desktop / kind).
3. Everyone on the team has a clear parallel workstream, learning path and deliverables they can complete and hand off.

Key platform choices (from your brief)

* Kafka: Strimzi on Kubernetes, KRaft mode (no ZooKeeper). Strimzi supports KRaft-mode clusters; newer Strimzi versions default to KRaft. ([strimzi.io][1])
* Spark: run Spark Streaming on Kubernetes (use a Spark operator / spark-submit on K8s). ([Apache Spark][2])
* Cassandra: statefulset on K8s (PVCs / StorageClass).
* Grafana: Deployment + datasource to Cassandra (or use an intermediate Prometheus/Pushgateway if needed).
* Kappa architecture: treat historical data as replayable streams (store in Kafka or replay from object store later).

---

# Overall phased plan (with checkpoints)

**Phase 0 — Environment & foundations (shared, everyone)** (1–3 days)

* Outcome: Team-wide working dev environment; central repo initialized; common tooling verified.
* Tasks:

  * Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop (or choose kind / minikube for CI parity). Verify `kubectl` points to it.
  * Create Git repo layout and a `README` with commands. Add `CODEOWNERS`.
  * Decide image registry for team (local Docker Desktop vs Docker Hub / GHCR) and create a small CI stub (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI).
* Checkpoint: `kubectl get nodes` and `kubectl create ns streaming` succeed; all team members can run `make dev-env-check`.

**Phase 1 — Kafka (KRaft) on Kubernetes (lead: Mễ)** (3–7 days)

* Outcome: Strimzi installed, a KRaft Kafka cluster running, topic(s) created via CRs; bootstrap services available for in-cluster and external access.
* Tasks (parallelizable):

  * Read Strimzi docs & KRaft notes. Install Strimzi operator into `kafka` namespace. (I can provide exact `kubectl apply` command and example CR.) ([strimzi.io][3])
  * Create Kafka CR (single-controller dev cluster → later scale to multiple controllers/brokers). Use ephemeral storage for dev; plan PVCs for staging/prod.
  * Create `KafkaTopic` CRs for `taxi_trips`, plus topic configuration (partitions, retention).
  * Create `KafkaUser` CRs (if you will use TLS/SASL) or start with plaintext for dev.
  * Validate in-cluster connectivity: deploy a tiny test pod that uses `kcat`/`kafkacat` to produce/consume.
* Checkpoint: `kubectl -n kafka get pods` show Kafka pods `Running`. `kubectl -n kafka get kafkatopics` shows `taxi_trips`. A test pod can produce and consume.

**Phase 2 — Local producer simulation & images (lead: Mễ, shared)**

* Outcome: Container images for producer (and test producers) that read your Yellow Taxi parquet/CSV and stream events to Kafka.
* Tasks:

  * Create `producer` Dockerfile and containerize `producer.py`. Support env vars: bootstrap server, topic, produce rate, start offset mode (random/steady).
  * Provide two modes: (a) file-to-Kafka (replay historic parquet), (b) synthetic generator (for load testing).
  * Add config for partitioning key (e.g., `pickup_zone`) and timestamp field (for watermark tests).
  * CI: build image in pipeline and push to registry (or note steps how to use local images with Docker Desktop).
* Checkpoint: `kubectl run` test pod using producer image successfully writes to `taxi_trips`.

**Phase 3 — Spark Structured Streaming on K8s (lead: Bảo, An)** (7–14 days)

* Outcome: Spark Structured Streaming job that consumes `taxi_trips`, applies watermarking and windowed aggregations (avg fare, trip count by zone), writes to Cassandra table, and can be managed on K8s (via Spark operator or `spark-submit` on K8s).
* Tasks (parallelizable):

  * Spark engineer 1 (Bảo): implement streaming job (`streaming.py`) with:

    * proper schema (read Avro/parquet/JSON formats).
    * watermarking (e.g., `withWatermark("event_time", "5 minutes")`).
    * window aggregates (sliding & tumbling) for metrics: `avg(fare)`, `count()` per zone.
    * write to Cassandra via Spark Cassandra connector (or write to Kafka topic for intermediate staging if preferred).
    * add exactly-once or idempotent write strategy (Cassandra upserts with partition keys + timestamp-based conditional writes).
    * unit/integration tests (local spark-submit in client mode).
  * Spark engineer 2 (An): platformize Spark on K8s:

    * choose operator (Kubeflow spark-operator, Stackable, or native `spark-submit` on K8s). Implement a `SparkApplication` YAML for the streaming job or a Job that runs driver+executors.
    * configure driver/executor resources, pod templates, logging (stdout -> ELK or stdout -> kubectl logs), tolerations/taints if applicable.
    * configure checkpointing location (use a PVC or S3-compatible object store) for offsets and stateful streaming.
    * test failover behavior by killing driver/executor pods and verifying state recovery.
  * Checkpoint: streaming job deployed via operator, consumes messages, writes to Cassandra. Streaming job survives a rolling restart with no data loss (within watermark tolerance).

**Phase 4 — Cassandra on Kubernetes (lead: Nam)** (4–8 days)

* Outcome: Cassandra cluster (statefulset) deployed with a well-designed schema for aggregated metrics; Spark can write to it and Grafana can query it.
* Tasks:

  * Design schema for time-series-like aggregates: table(s) keyed by (aggregation_window, zone_id, metric_type) with clustering by time bucket; TTL if you want to roll data off.
  * Deploy Cassandra statefulset with PVCs (use 3 nodes for dev parity if possible) or use a lightweight local mode for demo.
  * Install Spark Cassandra connector in Spark images and test writes/reads.
  * Create sample queries for Grafana (Cassandra -> Grafana datasource requires a connector; if Grafana cannot query Cassandra directly in your stack use an intermediate Prometheus or use a small API microservice that queries Cassandra and exposes metrics).
  * Implement data migration plan if schema changes are needed.
* Checkpoint: Inserted rows from Spark appear in Cassandra and can be read with `cqlsh` (or via the microservice).

**Phase 5 — Visualization (lead: Đức)** (3–7 days)

* Outcome: Grafana dashboards showing real-time metrics and historical/replayed metrics; alerting for anomalies.
* Tasks:

  * Deploy Grafana on K8s (Deployment + Service). Add dashboards and provisioning for datasources.
  * If Grafana cannot query Cassandra directly in your version, create a small HTTP API (fastapi) service that runs CQL queries and exposes metrics in Prometheus format OR push critical metrics to Prometheus from Spark.
  * Build two main dashboard panels:

    * Live metrics panel (avg fare, trip count per zone, updated every N seconds).
    * Periodic analytics panel (e.g., 1h, 24h aggregations).
  * Build an anomaly alert (Grafana alerting) when avg fare drops or trip counts spike/drop; configure test alerts.
* Checkpoint: Grafana displays live metrics and sends a test alert (Slack/email).

**Phase 6 — Observability, testing, security, CI/CD (parallel cross-cutting, all)**

* Outcome: Monitoring, logging, pipelines, and security baseline.
* Tasks:

  * Monitoring: Prometheus + JMX exporter for Kafka & Cassandra; Spark metrics exporter. Dashboards for cluster health.
  * Logging: centralize logs (ELK or Loki + Grafana).
  * E2E tests: an integration test that runs producer (short burst), runs streaming job, asserts rows in Cassandra.
  * CI: build images (producer, consumer/test harness, spark images) and push to registry; deploy manifests via `kubectl apply` or Helm; enforce PR checks.
  * Security: enable TLS and auth for Kafka (SASL/SCRAM), use `KafkaUser` CRs; secure Cassandra auth; enable network policies in K8s if needed.
* Checkpoint: CI pipeline builds images and runs an integration test that validates the pipeline in a test namespace.

**Phase 7 — Hardening & productionization (optional/pipelined after MVP)**

* Outcome: multi-replica Kafka, replication across nodes, PVC sizing, backups, disaster recovery playbook.
* Tasks:

  * Migrate to persistent storage classes (fast disks, replication).
  * Enable KRaft with multi-controller nodes (Strimzi node pools).
  * Backup/restore strategies for Cassandra and topics (export to object storage or use mirror-maker to replicate).
  * Define SLOs and run capacity tests (traffic generator).
* Checkpoint: Disaster recovery runbook validated on dev cluster.

# Short technical notes & important gotchas

1. **Strimzi & KRaft**: Strimzi supports KRaft-mode clusters and has special configuration (node pools, controller-only nodes, limitations during migration). Use Strimzi docs and choose a Strimzi version that supports the KRaft features you need. If migrating from older ZooKeeper clusters follow Strimzi migration docs. ([strimzi.io][1])

2. **Spark on K8s operator**: Use the official/community Spark operator to submit and manage Spark applications declaratively; it simplifies driver/executor lifecycle. Check Spark docs for `spark-submit` on K8s for driver networking & service setup. ([Apache Spark][2])

3. **Checkpointing & state**: For reliable structured streaming you must configure checkpointing (use durable storage: PVC or object store). Without checkpointing you risk duplicate processing and state loss.

4. **Cassandra writes from Spark**: Use the Spark-Cassandra connector and design writes to be idempotent where possible (upserts keyed by (time_window, zone)). Partitioning strategy matters for read/write performance — test with realistic rates.

5. **Local dev images**: Docker Desktop’s Kubernetes uses same Docker daemon — you can use locally built images by name with `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`. For CI/staging push to registry.

6. **Networking & bootstrap address**: For in-cluster clients, Strimzi exposes a bootstrap service `\<cluster-name\>-kafka-bootstrap.\<namespace\>:9092`. Use that in Spark and producer deployments. (Strimzi handles service names.) ([strimzi.io][3])

7. **Testing & load**: Start with low volumes and gradually increase; benchmark end-to-end throughput so you can size Spark executors, Kafka partition counts, and Cassandra nodes.

# Immediate next steps I can do right now (tell me which you want me to produce next)

Pick any — I’ll generate the artifact in this session immediately (no waiting):

* A ready-to-apply **Strimzi Kafka CR (KRaft dev cluster)** + `KafkaTopic` and `KafkaUser` examples tailored to your `taxi_trips`.
* A **producer Dockerfile** and K8s Deployment manifest that uses `producer.py` (I’ll adapt env vars to your script).
* A **Spark Structured Streaming example code** (PySpark `streaming.py`), along with a `SparkApplication` YAML to run it on Kubernetes.
* A **Cassandra schema DDL** for aggregated results, plus a sample StatefulSet YAML.
* A **Grafana dashboard JSON** for the live panel (simple JSON with queries placeholders).
* A combined **`make dev-deploy`** script that builds images and applies K8s manifests for dev.

Which of those should I create for you first? (If you want code/YAML, tell me: producer or streaming job first — I’ll generate it immediately.)
